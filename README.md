WildAmbienceAppeared is a fork of [Ambience Extras by viniciusgf2](https://github.com/viniciusgf2/Ambience), rewritten for better music compatibility with zones, dimensions, and more convenient changes for higher control over music play in a more desirable fashion for modpack authors.

Note: WildAmbienceAppeared is currently incomplete, so the CurseForge links will take you to viniciusgf2's version of Ambience Extras.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/viniciusgf2/Ambience/wiki) for more information on how to use the mod.

This modpack uses the [JLayer](http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html) library to play music.
